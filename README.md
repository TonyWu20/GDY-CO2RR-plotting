# GDY-CO2RR data visualization

## Brain-storming

1. 7 different bonding sites and symmetric/asymmetric
    - Emphasize difference between sites
    - Emphasize effect of asymmetric/symmetric
    - If obvious, plot
    - Not obvious, degenerate this dimension into one manually chosen option for
    other data
2. 44 transition/rare-earth elements from 4 periods.
    1. Compare within same period
    2. Compare between periods
    3. Use surface plot? Heatmap?
3. Adsorbates of different reaction pathways
    1. Correlation with the bonding sites
    2. Find energy pathways

## Data prediction

Prediction should start from the bare GDY-M model. Otherwise, the calculations
are still dependent on adsorbates and lack of general observations and
predictions.

1. Find parameters from bare model, and bonding atoms that can correlate with
   the adsorption performance.
